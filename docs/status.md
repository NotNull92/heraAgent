# Implementation status

## Bootstrap

- B0: native Windows root verified, no enclosing Git repository (git exit 128 expected).
- B1: initialized main, preserved three supplied handoff files; existing Git identity used.
- B2: authenticated GitHub personal account verified as NotNull92 using gh api user.
- B3: no local remotes; authenticated exact target lookup returned GraphQL not-found and REST 404.
- B4/B5: private creation and initial push verified. Historical receipt:
  fbf228d665ede1e20cb26ddce63f7c29f6594fa0 equals remote main; upstream origin/main.
- B6: subsequent milestones must review, test, scan and verify each push.
- No applicable ancestor or existing descendant AGENTS.md files were found before creating root instructions.
- Existing global hera command collision detected; leave it intact.

## Evidence categories

- windows_local: PowerShell 7.6.6; Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200 x64; Intel i7-12700;
  Node 24.12.0; npm 11.14.1; Git 2.52.0.windows.1; global Codex 0.160.1.
- Terminal/herdr version: unavailable in automation environment; manual checks not run.
- windows_ci: not created yet.
- macos_ci: not created yet.
- macos_manual_or_live: MANUAL_NOT_RUN / LIVE_NOT_RUN.
- Live GPT and external model checks: not run; credentials in Hera's isolated home not yet assessed.

The attempted codex.cmd version command failed because only codex.exe exists;
the verified native executable returned codex-cli 0.160.1 (exit 0). No global update.

## M0

Exact dependencies installed locally; npm install --ignore-scripts exit 0, audit 0 findings.
node scripts/generate-protocol.mjs exit 0; native-discovery.mjs exit 0;
native version/help/features inspection exit 0. Generated protocol and matching config
schema recorded. Live GPT: BLOCKED_NO_CREDENTIALS in isolated home.
Cross-provider and safety enforcement remain UNVERIFIED. See compatibility.md.

## M1

CLI/package/config foundation implemented with strict NodeNext and exact dependencies.
Windows: typecheck, offline tests (3), build and local --version all exit 0.
First typecheck found TS7 explicit types and generated directory-import requirements;
fixed the generator and config merge, reran successfully. Markdown hard-break whitespace
in the original handoff is preserved via .gitattributes.
Windows/macOS CI added; remote CI results are pending, not assumed passed.
M0 historical verified upload: 567ee2944d5d5fe56f5dd545fbed3eefef1ae7c2.

## M2

Pinned launcher, sanitized child environment, owned-process cleanup, bounded framed
RPC, generated request adapters, native account/catalog/thread/turn methods and atomic
reference metadata implemented. Unknown side-effect requests are surfaced, never granted.
Windows typecheck, offline tests (6), build and native:smoke all exit 0.
Native smoke initialized without credentials/inference; eight catalog entries returned.
Live conversation/resume and tools: BLOCKED_NO_CREDENTIALS; no paid calls made.
M1 verified upload: 0099c888329606ecfc5929699a104d2160e3192d.
CI run 37421528929 completed success (Windows and macOS offline jobs).

## M3 (implementation available; live acceptance blocked)

Explicit catalog model selection, native keyring login, account readiness, read-only
headless sessions, native resume, event streaming and reference-only persistence added.
Native settings map the worker default and concurrency limit; all worker paths remain
disabled until G02-G04 pass. A user must explicitly choose --single-agent; no fallback.
Windows typecheck, 8 offline tests, build, native smoke and doctor: exit 0.
Doctor on the actual Hera profile reported accountReady=false. Model catalog is not
entitlement. Live worker messages, concurrency and resume: BLOCKED_NO_CREDENTIALS.
This does not satisfy M3 live acceptance. M2 upload receipt:
c589315aae192e374596098d07dcb62c91eca36b.
